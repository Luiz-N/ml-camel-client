# When Gradle runs Camel, it sets fileUri and mlcpUri as system properties, which makes them available for configuration
# in the camel-routes.xml file.
#
# You can override them with a normal Gradle property flag - e.g. "gradle -PfileUri=/some/path camelRun".
#
# If you run this with the default fileUri, Camel will create an "inbox" directory in your project. That directory is
# ignored by Git. You can then copy files into it, and they will be imported into MarkLogic via the Content Pump Camel
# component.

# ml-gradle properties, in case you want to setup a REST API server too via "gradle mlDeploy"
# You can then run "gradle mlDeploy camelRun", adding "-PinboxUri" as needed
